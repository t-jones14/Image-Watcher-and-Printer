<configuration>
  <!-- Define application settings using the appSettings section.
       These settings will be used by the application to configure 
       the input/output folder paths, printer name, and log file location.
       Each setting is defined with a key-value pair. -->

  <appSettings>
    
    <!-- 
      InputFolder:
      - This is the folder that the application will monitor for new files.
      - The application will watch this directory for any new images (JPEG, BMP, TIFF).
      - If any new image file is detected, it will be automatically printed and processed.
      - Update this value to match the folder path where your input images will be placed.
      - Example: C:\Images\Input
    -->
    <add key="InputFolder" value="C:\\Images\\Input"/>
    
    <!-- 
      OutputFolder:
      - This is the folder where the application will move files after they have been printed.
      - Once a file is successfully printed, it will be moved to this directory.
      - This helps organize processed files and prevents reprocessing of the same file.
      - Update this value to match the folder path where you want finished/printed images to be stored.
      - Example: C:\Images\Finished
    -->
    <add key="OutputFolder" value="C:\\Images\\Finished"/>

    <!-- 
      LogFile:
      - This is the location where the application will write logs.
      - The log file will contain information about each processed file, including whether it was successfully printed or if any errors occurred.
      - This is useful for tracking the application's performance and troubleshooting.
      - Ensure that the folder where the log file is stored exists and the application has write permissions.
      - Update this value to the path where you want to store the log file.
      - Example: C:\Logs\fileProcessing.log
    -->
    <add key="LogFile" value="C:\\Logs\\fileProcessing.log"/>

    <!-- 
      PrinterName:
      - This is the name of the printer that the application will use to print the image files.
      - Ensure that the printer is installed and available on your system, and that the printer name matches exactly.
      - The printer name can be found in the system's Devices and Printers section or from the printer settings.
      - If this value is incorrect or the printer is unavailable, the application will fail to print the image files.
      - Update this value to match the printer name on your system.
      - Example: YourPrinterName (replace with the actual printer name)
    -->
    <add key="PrinterName" value="YourPrinterName"/>

  </appSettings>
  
  <!-- 
    Note:
    - All paths in the config file must use double backslashes `\\` or forward slashes `/` to avoid escape sequences.
    - Make sure to update all keys with correct values before running the application.
    - Be mindful of folder permissions, especially when writing to the output folder and log file.
